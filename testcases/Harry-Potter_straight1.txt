Line 1: Link for download. Usually a community where every story in it is slash/not-slash for easy testing
Line 2: Is this a slash or straight db
Line 3: path to database
Line 4 - first blank line or EOF: Stories that shouldnt be tested
Line after blank line: Not parsed. Can add comments, like these Line explanations

Issues:
14 errors to rule 5 (if romance + all males + numCharacters > 1)
1 error from rule 4 with /s/2291892/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Demon-s-Awakening.
