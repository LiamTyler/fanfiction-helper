Ideas for finding more slash stores:
- could maybe look for keyword "marry" / "marriage"?
- Could look for a sentence containing 2 male characters and a telling verb: love, kiss, etc.

Todo:
- Fix Story::first1kWords. Right now it only takes first 1k characters, not words. Sometimes it's not long enough, but ocassionally too long. Should look for delimiter, and store however many words that uses.
- Improve chapter 1 A/N delimiter search
- web interface
- Get it pulling stories ocassionally on old laptop
- plagiarism. Look at reviews perhaps? Often someone in the first 100 figures it out with a link to the original
