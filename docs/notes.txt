Finding gay stores:
- could maybe look for keyword "marry" / "marriage"?
- there are universe specific keywords that could be added, just like the gender list (HPDM, HPLV, etc). Seems like if people do include a universe specific keyword, they often skip the generic ones like "slash", etc.
- "homo" keyword?

Todo:
- plagiarism. Look at reviews perhaps? Often someone in the first 100 figures it out with a link to the original
